            "content": "Acknowledgment . Before starting on with this tutorial, I would like to mention a few names and resources without which this wouldn&#39;t have been possible. . Firstly, I would like to thank Jeremy Howard, Sylvain Gugger and Rachel Thomas for creating fastai, along with its course and their new book, Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch which makes Deep Learning easier and accessible than ever. Then I would like to thank Hamel Husain for creating fastpages, with which this entire blog post was made. It&#39;s such a great tool, and I would encourage everyone thinking of starting a blog to check it out! . And finally, I would like to thank the entire fastai community, for helping me out with my silly doubts on the forums and discord channel, special mention to Zach Mueller! . Introduction . In this tutorial, we&#39;ll look at how easy and fast training a state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network on the famous MNIST dataset can be using fastai. Then we&#39;ll use this model to create an API which when provided with an image input, will send back a response to the client. We will then deploy this API using Docker and Heroku to create your very own fully functioning web app. . Since this tutorial is going to be more focused on how to train a Deep Learning model, and deploy it for a web app, I expect the readers to have a basic understanding of how Neural Networks work, along with its underlying concepts such as Backpropagation, Gradient Descent etc. . If you&#39;re unfamiliar with these topics, I highly recommend you to take the fastai course. . Getting Started . Python packages . To get started, we need to install PyTorch, fastai and FastAPI on our system. Ideally, I would recommend everyone to use Anaconda/Miniconda to manage your Python packages and environments. . Assuming you have Anaconda/Miniconda installed, the following lines of code would install the required packages for this tutorial - . conda install pytorch torchvision cudatoolkit=10.2 -c pytorch pip install --upgrade fastai pip install fastapi[all] . Docker and Heroku . Installing is a pretty straightforward process that you can follow in their documentation, and if you&#39;re using Windows or Mac, I highly recommend installing the Docker Desktop. Once you&#39;re done installing it, you&#39;ll also have to sign up, which they ask you during the installation process. . You&#39;ll also need to install the Heroku CLI, which again, you can follow their documentation. Make sure you sign up on Heroku and have an account ready, as you&#39;ll be needing it later in the tutorial. . Development environment . If you&#39;ve followed the fastai course, you would know that the best way to write fastai code is in a IPython notebook environment, as fastai provides many additional features which help your training process much easier and insightful. Hence I would recommend everyone to either install Jupyterlab on their systems, or check out Google Colab, which provides you with a Notebook environment in your browser, along with GPU support!!. . For the rest of the tutorial, excluding the fastai code, I would recommend any text editor of your choice, but VSCode would be preferred as it provides with many features like type-checking for FastAPI. . Tip: If your system doesn&#8217;t have GPU support, I highly recommend using Google Colab as it will make training your model much faster! .",

            "content": "About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master- badges: true- comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . .

This guide provides more detail about this syntax, which looks like this: . For example, here is a footnote {% fn 1 %}. And another {% fn 2 %} {{ &#39;This is the footnote.&#39; | fndetail: 1 }} {{ &#39;This is the other footnote. You can even have a [link](www.github.com)!&#39; | fndetail: 2 }} .

            "content": "Example Markdown Post . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code .
